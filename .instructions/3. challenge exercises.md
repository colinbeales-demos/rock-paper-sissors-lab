# Challenge Exercises

Now you've had an opportunity to get started using GitHub Copilot, we have a number of challenges for you to attempt. Remember the goal here is not to test your programming abilities but rather, see how you can use GitHub Copilot to help you complete these tasks. Even if you've never programmed in Python, you may be surprised how Copilot can help you be successful with these challenge.

<summary>Challenge #1 - Adding Lizard and Spock to the game</summary>

### Adding Lizard and Spock to the game

- Improve the rock paper scissors game by adding Lizard and Spock.
  **Extra Kudos** for a terminal interface that provides a list of options with keyboard input.
  Eg.

```
$ Choose your option:
1.  Rock
2.  Paper
3.  Scissors
4.  Lizard
5.  Spock
```

<summary>Challenge #2 - Adding Unit Tests</summary>

### Adding Unit Tests

- Try asking Copilot Chat, what unit test frameworks are available
- Implement unit tests using any testing module of your choice.
  Try to aim for 100% coverage :)
- Try asking Copilot Chat, how to make your code more testable
- Try using the /tests command in Copilot Chat to help generate more tests
- Try asking Copilot Chat, how to run your tests? and try running them.

<summary>Challenge #3 - Adding a REST API</summary>

### Adding a REST API

- Turn it into a REST API
  E.g. sending a POST /rock (or json payload) should return a 200 OK response with the result in the body
- Try asking Copilot Chat, how do I write a REST API in your chosen language?
- Try asking Copilot Chat, questions to help you get your API implemented
- Try using the inline chat function (Command-I/CTRL-I) in VSCode to ask a question inside the editor (e.g. select a method and invoke the chat and ask it to make your code more readable, or document it)
- If you get an errors try /fix in Copilot chat to help you fix the problem you have.
