## Workshop exercises

### Golang Core exercise

The following golang exercises will help you get started with GitHub Copilot. You must have completed the [setup instructions](<./1. setup.md>) before starting these steps.

<summary>Building a Rock Paper Scissors game with GitHub Copilot</summary>

### Step by step instructions

1. Ensure you can see the files in the **Explorer view**. If not, click the **Explorer View icon** on the left sidebar of your editor.

2. Open the `main.go` file if it's not already open in the editor.
3. Let's start by adding the following comment to provide some context for the code we're about to write:

```
// Write a rock, paper, scissors game
// take user input and compare it to a random choice from the computer
```

:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:

4. When you press **Enter** after typing the previous comment, GitHub Copilot will suggest some code for you. Select the first suggestion by pressing **TAB** then **Enter** again.

5. On the next line we're going to prompt GitHub Copilot to suggest our imports code for us by typing the following:

`// import packages` :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:

6. When you press **Enter** after typing the previous comment, GitHub Copilot will suggest some code for you. Select the first suggestion by pressing **TAB** then **Enter** again. Keep doing the same to accept the import packages for fmt and math/rand. **_Note: If Copilot tries to add any additional packages like time just don't accept that suggestion and close out the imports with a close bracket `)` character_**

6. Now we're going to prompt GitHub Copilot to suggest code for us by typing the following:

`// main function` :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:

7. When you press **Enter** after typing the previous comment, GitHub Copilot will again suggest some code for you. Select the first suggestion by pressing **TAB** then **Enter** again.
8. **Pause briefly** while Copilot creates up to 10 suggestions for you. You should see the Copilot icon in the lower right corner of the editor spinning. When Copilot displays the first suggestion, we're going to open the GitHub Copilot suggestion panel by pressing **CTRL + ENTER**.
9. Scroll down the list of suggestions that GitHub Copilot has made and choose the one that looks like the best option for our Rock, Paper, Scissors game. When you see the suggestion you want, click **Accept Solution** to have that code snippet inserted into your code file.

**Now we're ready to see if this code executes** :thumbsup:

> **NOTE:** To run the golang code, you'll need to have Go installed on your computer.

13. In the Terminal window, type the following command and press **Enter** to run the code:

`go run main.go` :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:

Here's an example of what the completed game might look like.

> Hopefully your Paper, Rock, Scissors game is working! Remember, GitHub Copilot is probabilistic so you may not get the exact same code suggestions as we did. If you're not happy with the suggestions, you can always press **CTRL + Z** to undo the changes and try again.

You're now ready to start the [challenge exercises](<./3. challenge exercises.md>) to see how you can leverage the power of GitHub Copilot to solve a number of challenges yourself.
