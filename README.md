# GitHub Copilot Workshop

## Build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game from scratch with GitHub Copilot

<img width="400" alt="Rock Paper Scissors image" src="./assets/Rock Paper Scissors image.png">

In this fun workshop, you will learn how to use GitHub Copilot to build a simple game in Python, with little to no coding experience required.

Estimated time to complete: `10 to 60 minutes`

Participants will be guided to install the GitHub Copilot VS Code extension, follow a CodeTour to learn how to interact with GitHub Copilot, and then use GitHub Copilot to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game from scratch. 

Depending on the time available, participants will be able to complete the game or just get started, from a simple version all the way to introducing additional logic to make the game more interesting complete, with unit tests and REST API endpoints.

## FAQ 

- **How do I get a GitHub Copilot setup in my IDE?**
  - Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/getting-code-suggestions-in-your-ide-with-github-copilot). The tabs at the top allow you to pick your IDE which gives specific steps for the chosen IDE.
- **What language can I use for the lab?**
    - There are files in place for you to use Pythonb or Go, however Copilot supports all languages, therefore if you have the tools in your environment for a different language then Copilot can heelp you write code for your chosen language. Just create a new codefile and start getting suggestions.
